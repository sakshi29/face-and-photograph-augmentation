# face-and-photograph-augmentation
This project  augument photographs by adding mask to the target photograph and also add instagram-like effects such as vignetting, gradient
blurring and color filtering. 
Any photo can be used to make the mask.
Used Neural Networks to detect facial keypoints.
Used Lasagne and create a neural net with a single hidden layer.

The training dataset for the Facial Keypoint Detection challenge consists of 7,049 96x96 gray-scale images.
The complete dataset is available at https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/data .
